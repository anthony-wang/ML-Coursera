# A. Ng's process
# Part 1: load and visualize data
# Part 2: load parameters
# Part 3: compute cost (feedforward)
# Part 4: regularization
# Part 5: sigmoid gradient
# Part 6: initialize parameters
# Part 7: backpropagation
# Part 8: train NN
# Part 9: visualize trained parameters (weights)
# Part 10: predict

# Flux's MLP https://github.com/hpoit/ML-Coursera/blob/master/week%204/ang_assignment3-v02-mlp.jl
# covers Parts 1-10 except 9, which has yet to be built for Flux
# Jesse Bettencourt suggested reading https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/
# I would like to implement it to Flux
